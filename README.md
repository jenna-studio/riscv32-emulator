# RISC-V 32-bit Emulator IDE

A comprehensive RISC-V 32-bit processor emulator with an integrated development environment (IDE) built using Electron, featuring Monaco Editor and xterm.js for a modern debugging experience.

## References

This project was developed with reference to the [CPUlator Computer System Simulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=rv32-spim), which provided valuable insights into RISC-V processor simulation and educational interface design.

**Note**: This repository is forked from an original implementation. Please refer to the git history and contributors for the complete development lineage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   C++ compiler (for building the emulator core)
-   Make (for building the emulator binary)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd riscv32-emulator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the emulator core**

    ```bash
    npm run build-emu
    # or manually:
    make
    ```

4. **Start the application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or for development with logging:
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Load Assembly Files**: Use "Open .s" to load RISC-V assembly files or "New .s" to create new ones
2. **Compile and Load**: Click "Compile and Load" to prepare your program for execution
3. **Set Breakpoints**: Click on line numbers or use the breakpoint controls
4. **Execute**: Use "Step Into" for single-step debugging or "Continue" for running multiple instructions

### Debug Controls

-   **Step Into**: Execute one instruction at a time
-   **Continue**: Run 100 instructions (or until breakpoint)
-   **Run**: Execute program from the beginning
-   **Stop**: Halt execution

### Navigation

-   **Go Button**: Jump to specific line numbers, addresses, or labels
-   **Mem Button**: Examine memory at specific addresses
-   **Status Button**: View comprehensive program status

### Panel Overview

-   **Terminal**: Interactive command interface with GDB-style commands
-   **Registers**: Real-time register display with ABI names and roles
-   **Memory**: Formatted memory inspection with multiple display options
-   **Source**: Current source code with execution highlighting
-   **Disassembly**: Machine code disassembly with instruction details
-   **Statistics**: Performance metrics and instruction counters
-   **Symbol Table**: Program symbols, functions, and labels
-   **Call Stack**: Function call hierarchy and return addresses

## Example Programs

The IDE includes several example programs in the `example_questions/` directory:

-   **Graph Algorithms** (`graph.c/s`): Graph traversal and manipulation
-   **Array Reduction** (`reduction.c/s`): Parallel reduction operations
-   **Sorting Algorithms** (`sort.c/s`): Various sorting implementations
